# FontFool

Font indexing and organization.

## WORK IN PROGRESS

This is a pre-release demo which is not fully connected between CLI->API->Angular.

Currently this only loads/displays Bitstream Vera Sans Mono.

## TODO:

* Make Requirements
* All Unit Tests
* Clean Up Styles
* Do Better UX
* Connect to DB
* Connect Search
* Add Additional Pages
* Figure out how to dynamically load an @font-face
* Figure out a better way to load and store a massive amount of fonts for the list.
* ???

## Test Me

Using:

* Angular CLI: 10.2.1
* Node: 15.6.0

      git clone git@github.com:pjobson/FontFool.git
      cd FontFool

I use `autoenv`, if you don't, do:

      source .env

Install and serve

      npm install
      ng serve
